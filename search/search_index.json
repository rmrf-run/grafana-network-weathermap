This will provide you with an instance to play around with. To install unsigned to your own Grafana instance, download the latest release zip . This page will be updated once this plugin is officially on the Grafana plugin store (which you will be able to install from there or using their cli). Creating a New Weathermap In Grafana, create a new Empty Panel . Change the visualisation in the top right corner to Network Weathermap . You now have a brand new network weathermap panel! \ud83c\udf89 Learn about weathermap basics below! On Startup By default, the panel will start completely blank, looking something like this: Adding Nodes Make sure you have selected Edit on the panel in Grafana. On the right hand side, find the Nodes editor. Click Add Node to create a new node. Nodes have three basic fields: X position ( number ): Node's X position. Y position ( number ): Node's Y position. Label ( string ): The text visible on the node. You can then move the node by dragging it with your mouse. Adding Links Ensure you have at least two nodes. On the right hand side, find the Links editor. Click Add Link to create a new link. Links are split into two sides, A and B . Each side has four central fields: Side ( Node ): The node this side of the link connects to. Query ( Query ): A query representing the current side's throughput in bits/sec . Bandwidth # ( number ): A number representing the bandwidth of this side in bits . Bandwidth Query ( Query ): A query representing the bandwidth of this side in bits . Select A and B side nodes from their respective dropdowns. Adding Data The weathermap expects a data frame with two fields, a time and a number. This number should always be in bits/s (or just bits if you have a query for bandwidth). The weathermap works best with 'instant' queries, which just use the most recent value retrieved. (Otherwise, the weathermap will always choose the most recent data point possible). Once you have added a query in the panel editor, you can can see all queries and select one from the dropdown in the Query fields of the links. Setting Thresholds The weathermap color scale allows you to color links based on their bandwidth usage. On the right hand side, find the Color Scale editor. Click Add Scale Value to create a new threshold. Each threshold has two basic fields: % ( number ): The percent of bandwidth usage at which to start this threshold. Color ( picker ): The color of this threshold, can be any valid CSS color chosen or input with the picker. green | #00FF00 | rgb(0, 255, 0) By default, the scale will fill from the highest threshold to 100%. You can see the scale in the top left of the panel.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#getting-started","text":"","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#installation","text":"For testing with Docker, follow the instructions on the testing README .

Common Terminology The diagram below illustrates some of the basic terminology this plugin uses. Panel Settings There are three main panel settings: Background Color ( color ): Use the picker to set whatever background you want (including transparent). Viewbox Width ( number ): The width in pixels of the SVG viewbox. Viewbox Height ( number ): The height in pixels of the SVG viewbox. By default, the panel's SVG will attempt to take up as much space both vertically and horizontally within the Grafana plugin panel as possible while still maintaining the viewbox aspect ratio. You can also pan and zoom on the panel. Zooming works with just your mousewheel, and panning can be triggered by dragging the panels view using middle click or holding control while using left click. Arranging Links One of the most important parts of creating a weathermap is arranging the links between nodes. Depending on the orientation of these links, some specific settings may work best. PLEASE NOTE: Links are drawn in the order in which they are added to a node, meaning some may overlap if you aren't careful when adding them. While a future version may make some easier way to deal with this, for now you can just remove the relevant links and re-add them in the necessary order. Link Options Anchors: Each node has 5 anchors that any link side can connect to: ( Center | Top | Bottom | Left | Right ) This makes it easy to try and avoid having too many overlapping links. By default, links are auto-spaced to be as far apart as possible when parallel to each other vertically (attached to a Bottom of one link, and Top of another). When parallel vertically (attached to a Right of one link, and Left of another), nodes will automatically grow to accomodate them. Label Offset # ( number ): A number between 0 and 100 representing the location of the link's label as a percentage of that link's length. (Play around with it to see how it works! This is especially useful if you have close / overlapping links which need their labels to not overlap.) Global Link Options These options are set on all links. Base Color ( picker ): The no-data color for links. Stroke Width ( number ): A number in pixels, representing the stroke width of all links. Spacing Horizontal ( number ): A number in pixels, representing the spacing used between links when a node has Constant Spacing set to true. Spacing Vertical ( number ): A number in pixels, representing the spacing used vertically between links, when a node has Collapse Vertical Links set to false (the default). These options are for link labels (their current throughput): Background ( color ): Label background color. Border ( color ): Label border color. Font ( color ): Label font color. Global Arrow Options These options are set on all arrows. Width ( number ): The width of the arrow in pixels. (You probably want it >= the link stroke width.) Height ( number ): The height of the arrow in pixels (how long it looks). Offset ( number ): The distance from the meeting point of the two links the point of the arrow will reach to. This is the offset for one side of the link, meaning the actual space between two arrows will be twice this number. Node Options: Icon Select one of the icons from the existing library to attach it to a node. Width ( number ): Icon bounding box width. Height ( numer ): Icon bounding box height. Padding, Horizontal & Vertical ( number , number ): Padding between the icon's bounding box and node edges or text. Draw Inside ( boolean ): When true, will put the icon within the node's border (you may need to adjust the padding a little). Padding Padding, Horizontal & Vertical ( number , number ): represents the spacing between the text and the border. Advanced In the Advanced section of the Nodes editor, there are two toggles: Constant Spacing: Should links be a certain Link Spacing Horizontal (px) apart? This setting is useful if you have two nodes with signficant differences in text length, as by default the plugin will space links evenly across a Top | Bottom anchor. Switching to a constant spacing forces these links to be the same pixel distance apart. Compact Vertical Links: Should nodes ignore the number of links attached to their sides? This setting lets you decide whether an individual node will grow when there is more than one link attached to either Left | Right anchor. When on, a node will always only be the size of its text and padding. When off, a node will grow so that links going left to right do not overlap (these links will be Link Spacing Vertical (px) apart). Colors Background ( picker ): Node background color. Border ( picker ): Node border color. Font ( picker ): Node font color. Font Options Node Font Size ( number ): All nodes' font size. Link Font Size ( number ): All links' label font size.","title":"Visual Customization"},{"location":"customization/#visual-customization","text":"Once you've gotten a basic layout done, you may be wondering how to customize the way things look, to suit your personal feel.","title":"Visual Customization"},{"location":"customization/#common-terminology","text":"The diagram below illustrates some of the basic terminology this plugin uses.","title":"Common Terminology"},{"location":"customization/#panel-settings","text":"There are three main panel settings: Background Color ( color ): Use the picker to set whatever background you want (including transparent).
